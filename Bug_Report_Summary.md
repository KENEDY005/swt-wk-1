## 💭 Reflection  

Answer briefly (1–2 paragraphs):

- What was your testing approach? Dynamic Testing  
- What did you find easy or difficult during the task?  It was easy to identify the issues. I find it hard to open using live server on my pc. "when I right click the html file and select open by live server nothing shows up. i had to go to the cloned repo and click on the html file for it to open with chrome."

It was also hard to specify which requirement is affected.
- How confident are you now in identifying and reporting bugs? Very confident
